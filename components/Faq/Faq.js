    <FaqItem title="Why should I use Fast Selling Solutions?">
      <p>
        At the heart of our business, we are problem solvers. Our clients are typically going through a difficult situation and their house has become a burden.
        Not only do we buy problem properties as-is, but we focus on putting you in a better situation. We will tailor our approach to your unique problem so
        you can leave with the right solution and a weight lifted off your shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our services may not be for everyone. Depending on your situation, you may be better off listing your house with a real estate agent. However, that is not
        always the best option. Our professional home buying services are an excellent solution if you are going through any of the following situations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You need to sell your house quickly.</li>
        <li>Your house needs significant repairs.</li>
        <li>Your house needs a major cleanout.</li>
        <li>You are behind on mortgage payments.</li>
        <li>You are facing foreclosure.</li>
        <li>You inherited a house that you do not want.</li>
        <li>You owe more than the house is worth.</li>
        <li>You own one or more rental properties and no longer want to be a landlord.</li>
      </ul>

    <FaqItem title="How are you different than listing with a real estate agent?">
      <p>
        A real estate agent&apos;s job is to find a buyer by listing your house on the MLS. They find buyers by planting
        a For Sale sign in your yard, marketing your property to the public, and scheduling multiple showings to prospective
        buyers. This process can take weeks or months before closing, and it will cost you approximately 6% of the home&apos;s purchase
        price in commissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        When working with Fast Selling Solutions, we are the home buyer. No sign in the yard, no listings, no waiting
        to find a buyer, and no commissions/fees. We close on your schedule, and we can typically close within 30 days. Our services are designed to
        take the burden off your shoulders as effortlessly as possibly so you can get on with your life. There is no need to clean out the
        house or make any repairs. We handle all of that.
      </p>
    </FaqItem>
    <FaqItem title="What is a &quot;professional home buyer?&quot;">
      <p>
        Fast Selling Solutions is a professional home buying company. We buy houses as-is so you don&apos;t need to clean out the property or make
        any repairs. Our offers are all-cash so we can close quickly, often within 30 days. There are no fees or commissions to work with us and no
        obligation to accept our offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond buying your house, we also make sure you are in a better position after the sale. That means ensuring you have a
        place to live, or you have what you need to move forward with your life. Making every transaction a win-win for all parties is a requirement
        for our business.
      </p>
    </FaqItem>
    <FaqItem title="What is the process to work with you?">
      <p>
        You can expect the following steps when working with us to buy your house:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The process begins by you calling/texting us at
          {' '}
          <a className="phone" href="tel:920-298-1170">920-298-1170</a>
          {' '}
          or submitting your
          property address through our
          {' '}
          <Link href="/contact">
            <a>contact us</a>
          </Link>
          {' '}
          form.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will have a conversation with you to gather more information about your property and your situation. The property information we&apos;re
          looking for generally includes size, type, condition, and current amount owed, but we are also seeking information about how to best solve
          your situational problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          If both you and we feel comfortable moving forward, we will schedule an appointment to assess the property. Once we&apos;ve had a look, we
          will make you an offer. There is no obligation to accept our offer and no cost to you for the appointment.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you decide to accept our offer, we will review and sign the Wisconsin State approved Offer to Purchase contract. Our team will handle the
          rest of process until closing day. We stay in touch with you frequently to ensure you know what&apos;s going on and are comfortable every step of the way.
        </li>
        <li>
          On closing day, we will meet at the title company to sign the final paperwork and transfer the cash to your bank account.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </FaqItem>
    <FaqItem title="What are my obligations after I contact you?">
      <p>
        There are zero obligations to you. Once you submit your info, we&apos;ll follow up with you to discuss your property and may even schedule a visit. After a
        quick assessment, we&apos;ll make you a fair, all-cash offer. Your decision to accept our offer is 100% up to you, but it&apos;s good for you to at least hear
        what we&apos;re offering!
      </p>
    </FaqItem>
    <FaqItem title="Are there any fees/commissions to work with you?">
      <p>
        There are zero fees and zero commissions to work with us! Unlike listing your house with a real estate agent (where a percentage of the sale is paid to them),
        we are buying your house directly. The benefits to you are that we can close quickly, we handle all cleanup and repairs, and you avoid the fees/commissions
        associated with typical real estate agent transactions.
      </p>
    </FaqItem>
    <FaqItem title="Will you be listing my house on the MLS?">
      <p>
        No, we will not be listing your house on MLS. Instead, we would be buying your house directly. This approach gives you the speed and convenience of an all-cash
        offer so you can avoid open houses and long, drawn-out waiting periods before closing.
      </p>
    </FaqItem>
    <FaqItem title="Will you offer me a fair price for my home?">
      <p>
        The properties we typically buy are below market value. We are looking for a fair discount so we can put in the necessary updates or repairs before reselling
        it for profit to another homeowner.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, many sellers we work with aren&apos;t expecting a large return on their property, but rather appreciate the benefits of an all-cash offer. An all-cash
        offer allows us to close quickly (no waiting on financing), frees you from paying fees/commissions, and requires no time or effort on you to clean up or make repairs.
        If you see value in selling your house fast, we&apos;d love to work with you to find a win-win solution!
      </p>
    </FaqItem>
    <FaqItem title="What kinds of houses do you buy?">
      <p>
        We buy many types of properties including single family homes, multi-family (duplex, triplex, 4-plex), mobile homes, commercial buildings, and even small apartments.
        Furthermore, we buy house in any condition, and we buy as-is, so you don&apos;t need to make any updates, repairs, or even clean up. We handle all of that.
